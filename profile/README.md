# A new era has begun...

The [MOS](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agon-mos) and [VDP](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agon-vdp) firmware produced for Agon platform computers under the "Agon Console8" label has always been completely compatible with the Agon Light, Olimex Agon Light 2, the Agon Light Origins Edition, as well as the Agon Console8.  The label, however has historically tended to cause some confusion...

The organisation on GitHub has also become the home to various tools for the Agon platform, such as the [Agon firmware update utility](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agon-vdp) tool, the [agon-ez80asm assembler](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agon-ez80asm), and the new [Agon dev C/C++ toolchain](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agondev) amongst many others.

To better reflect the nature of the organisation we have therefore decided to rename it to be [AgonPlatform](https://github.com/AgonPlatform).
